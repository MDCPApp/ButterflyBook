## Overview
### Description
Butterfly Book is an online collection of stories, pictures, videos, and other media uploaded by people who have lost a loved one

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** It is pretty mobile. Instead of only being able to access collections and feeds from a laptop or computer, a user can view their feed whenever, wherever. Moreover, one of the main reasons for this app was so that whenever someone remembers a story of a loved one, they can immediately post it on the feed instead of waiting until they can reach a desktop, possibly forgetting the story by that time.
- **Story:** I feel the story behind this app is very compelling. When discussing the idea with friends and family, feedback was given that people are already doing a workaround for this, and the app would solve that workaround and definitely be used. 
- **Market:** The market for this app is anyone who can operate a mobile device and has experienced the loss of someone in their life.
- **Habit:** The habit of how much a user consumes and creates on the app is dependent on the user. Some users will post and read daily, while others may check monthly. It is predicted that after a recent loss users would be more likely to use the app, and as time goes on slowly use it less.
- **Scope:** An MVP for this app is possible by the end of the semester if it is designed such as the flix and parstagram orojects. For additional user stories and nice to have features, it would probably take longer than before the semester is over.
